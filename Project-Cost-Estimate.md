## Executive Summary

### Project Overview

Development of a custom AI-powered unified business intelligence platform tailored specifically for ECI's unique business needs. **Module 1 focuses on proposal management** as the foundation, with a clear (optional) roadmap to expand into CRM & resource allocation, as well as data aggregation with project intelligence.

The initial system will replace manual proposal processes, reduce Executive time spent on proposals by 80%+, preserve institutional knowledge, and demonstrate the platform vision that addresses identified business pain points.

### Investment Summary

| Module | Deliverable | Development Time | Investment |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Module 1** | AI Assisted Proposal Management Application | ~3-4 weeks | $37,125 |
| **Module 2** | CRM & Resource Allocation System | ~4-6 weeks | $48,375 |
| **Module 3** | Data Aggregation with Project Intelligence | ~2 weeks | $18,000 |
| **Total** | **Full Business Intelligence Platform (3 Modules)** | **~9-12 weeks*** | **$103,500** |

*Development of each module can run in parallel (overlapping sprints) or in "waterfall" execution (complete each module before beginning the next).

### Cost Comparison vs. Off-The-Shelf Solutions

| Solution | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | 3-Year Total |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------------|
| **OpenAsset Shred.ai** | $15,000 | $15,000 | $15,000 | **$45,000** |
| **Unanet Proposal AI** | $12,500 | $12,500 | $12,500 | **$37,500** |
| **Responsive** | $12,500 | $12,500 | $12,500 | **$37,500** |
| **Custom Solution (Module 1 Only)** | $37,125 | $3,000 | $3,000 | **$43,125** |
| **Custom Platform (All 3 Modules)** | $103,500 | $3,500 | $3,500 | **$110,500** |

**Note:** Off-the-shelf solutions only address proposal management. ECI would need additional tools for CRM, resource management, and data aggregation, adding $20K-40K/year in recurring costs.

**Break-even Point (Module 1 Only):** Month 24 vs. Shred.ai
**Break-even Point (Full Platform):** Month 32 vs. multiple vendor solution
**5-Year Savings (Full Platform):** $85,000 - $145,000 vs. vendor silos
**10-Year Savings (Full Platform):** $210,000 - $310,000 vs. vendor silos

## ROI Analysis

### Time Savings Calculation

**Current State:**

- Ted spends ~15 hours/week on proposals (60 hours/month)
- Hourly CEO value: ~$200/hr (based on $400K salary equivalent)
- Monthly cost of current process: 60 × $200 = **$12,000/month**

**Future State with AI System:**

- Estimated time reduction: 80% (12 hours/week saved)
- New time on proposals: 3 hours/week (12 hours/month)
- Monthly time savings value: 48 × $200 = **$9,600/month**

**Annual Savings:**

- Time savings: $9,600 × 12 = **$115,200/year**
- Avoided proposal manager hire: **$80,000/year** (salary + benefits)
- **Total Annual Value: $195,200**
